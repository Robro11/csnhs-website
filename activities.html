       <h3 class="subtext"> The Lamar Computer Science National Honor Society is proud to announce its very first collaborative coding project. The Lamar CSNHS members have chosen the 2022 Hackathon project, it will be a completely automized made to order coffee & waffle machine. The focal point of the project is to allow members to creatively explore in a collaborative community with software and engineering. Members will be working unaided to come up with ideas, materials, code, design elements and product testing the machine. The project is completely student led and monitored, it is an opportunity for students to truly showcase their ability and creativity in computer science outside of the classroom in an amazing environment. In the end all members will be able to reap the benefits of their hard work with coffee and waffles at school!!!</h3>
